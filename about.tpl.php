        <h2>The Bière Library Story</h2>
        <div class="grid">
            <p class="content">
                The Bière Library is a craft beer bar and restaurant serving Corvallis, Oregon. Inspired by the beer and cuisine of Belgium, The Bière Library explores the relationship between beer and food in an environment reminiscent of a comfortable library. A small, well-curated selection of local craft and import beer rotate frequently on draft and in bottles, with an emphasis on quality and diversity of styles. The food menu features Belgian comfort food, described by Chef Travis as a cross between traditional German food portions and the refinement of French cooking techniques.

                <p>Chef Travis Allen is a graduate of Seattle Culinary Academy and has spent the last several years recipe testing and experimenting with Belgian recipes and Cuisine â la Bière (cooking with beer).
                </p>

                <p>Chef Travis’s passion for good beer and great food began on a trip to Belgium and he continues to find inspiration from old world recipes as well as the fine meats and produce the Pacific Northwest has to offer. His time spent cooking at Ray's Boathouse in Seattle and The Dizzy Hen in Philomath honed his skills and furthered his passion for good food.</p>

                <p>Travis served in the military from 2007-2013 before completing a B.A. in Philosophy at Western Oregon University. He hopes The Bière Library will be a warm and welcoming environment for fellow veterans and people from all walks of life.</p>
